# Task 5
There are n coins placed in a row. The goal is to form n/2 pairs of them by a sequence of moves. On the first move a
single coin has to jump over one coin adjacent to it, on the second move a single coin has to jump over two adjacent
coins, on the third move a single coin has to jump over three adjacent coins, and so on, until after n/2 moves n/2 coin
pairs are formed. (On each move, a coin can jump right or left but it has to land on a single coin. Jumping over a coin
pair counts as jumping over two coins. Any empty space between adjacent coins is ignored.) Determine all the values
of n for which the problem has a solution and design an algorithm that solves it in the minimum number of moves for
those nâ€™s.
<br>
Design greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of moves.
