# Task 4
There are eight disks of different sizes and four pegs. Initially, all the disks are on the first peg in order of size, the largest
on the bottom and the smallest on the top.
Use divide and conquer method to transfer all the disks to another peg by a sequence of moves. Only one disk can be
moved at a time, and it is forbidden to place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
Does the Dynamic Programing algorithm can solve the puzzle in 33 moves? If not then design an algorithm that
solves the puzzle in 33 moves.
